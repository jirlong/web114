# Instructions for Editing Text in HTML Files
When editing text content in HTML files, please follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency:
1. Using bootstrap and jquery CDN links as in the template file.
2. After making changes, update the README.md file to reflect the changes made in the HTML files. Adding update date after each edited file is recommended.
